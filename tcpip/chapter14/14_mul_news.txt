Supercomputers from all over the world are usually powered-up by US-based chips. But last year, Washington had forbidden TaihuLight to utilize 'Made in America' hardware equipment.

The Chinese supercomputer manufacturer, Sunway, installed it at the National Supercomputing Center and achieved remarkable progress despite obstacles. Fu Haohuan, deputy director of the project, touted his nationâ€™s advancements.

"It highlights China's ability to conduct independent research in the supercomputing field," Fu told Xinhua." China is simultaneously developing hardware and software technologies for supercomputers."

He added, "It is expected that rapid development in homegrown hardware technologies, supported by homegrown software, will lead to stronger research and engineering testing capacity in many fields."

China has made tremendous progress for the domestic supercomputer industry. Nonetheless, China faces stiffer competition from other nations down the road.

The EU and US governments are pouring major investment funds to accelerate the R&D (research and development) of their respective homegrown supercomputers.
